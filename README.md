- **React**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. React allows for the creation of reusable components and efficient rendering.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build complex designs without leaving your HTML. It promotes rapid development and ensures consistency across the UI.
- **Vite**: A modern build tool that offers a fast development experience with instant server start, hot module replacement, and optimized production builds. Vite is highly efficient and suitable for modern web development.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript/TypeScript code. It helps maintain code quality by enforcing coding standards and preventing common errors.
- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent style by parsing code and reprinting it with its own rules. It helps keep the codebase clean and readable.
- **PostCSS**: A tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins. TailwindCSS is built on top of PostCSS, allowing for additional CSS transformations and optimizations.
- **Autoprefixer**: A PostCSS plugin that adds vendor prefixes to CSS rules automatically, ensuring compatibility across different browsers.
